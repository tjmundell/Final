        <p>The main question I was looking to answer
            with this chart was which field of study accepted the most students. The x-axis on the chart represents the field of study while the y-axis represents the number of students that were accepted into that particular area. Based on the chart, Astronomy accepted the most students with 601. Meanwhile, Biology accepted the least amount of students. This is most likely due to the number of students interested in each respective field. The chart combines both male and female students into one collective.
